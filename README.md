# ðŸ“š Udemy Courses Analysis Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview
This project involved analyzing an Udemy courses dataset to create an interactive dashboard using **Power BI**.  
The aim was to transform raw data into a clean, combined dataset and visualize key metrics like subscribers, revenue, course ratings, and subject performance to support better decision-making.

## 2. Process Workflow

âž” **Data Extraction**  
- Dataset extracted from **Google Drive** into **Power BI**.

âž” **Data Transformation (Power Query Editor)**  
- Removed empty columns.  
- Cleaned out empty cells across columns.  
- Changed data types where necessary (e.g., Text, Number).  
- Appended 4 tables into a **Combined Query**.  
- Renamed the appended table appropriately.  
- Removed **null values** from the "Subject" column.  
- Removed duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.

âž” **Data Loading**  
- Loaded and applied the cleaned and combined dataset into the Power BI data model.

âž” **Visualization**  
Built several visualizations including:
- Total Subscribers
- Total Courses
- Total Reviews
- Total Revenue
- Average Rating
- Subscribers by Subject
- Revenue by Subject
- Subscribers by Level
- Revenue by Level
- Revenue Trend by Year
- Top 15 Courses by Subscribers

## 3. Insights Derived
- **Total Subscribers**: 12 Million
- **Total Courses**: 3687
- **Total Reviews**: 575K
- **Total Revenue**: 244K
- **Average Rating**: 0.61
- **Top Subject**: Web Development with the highest subscribers (~8M).
- **Paid vs Free Courses**: 30.44% Paid and 69.56% Free.
- **Top Level**: "All Levels" courses had the most subscribers (~6.3M).
- **Trend**: Revenue and subscribers showed steady growth from 2011 to 2017, peaking in 2016.

## 4. Business Questions Explored
ðŸ“Œ Which subjects have the highest number of subscribers and revenue?  
ðŸ“Œ How do paid and free courses differ in subscriber numbers?  
ðŸ“Œ How does course level (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) affect subscriber counts and revenue?  
ðŸ“Œ What is the yearly trend in subscribers and revenue growth?  
ðŸ“Œ Which courses are the top performers by number of subscribers?

## 5. Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts on **Web Development** and **Business Finance** subjects to maximize reach.
- Increase creation of **"All Levels"** courses as they attract more subscribers.
- Boost paid courses offering as they still contribute a good share despite being fewer than free courses.
- Prepare marketing and promotional strategies to leverage revenue growth trends.
